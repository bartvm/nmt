        ----------
        req : str or dict
            Control request received from a worker.
            The control request can be one of the following
            1) "next" : request by a worker to be informed of its next action
               to perform. The answers from the server can be 'train' (the
               worker should keep training on its training data), 'valid' (the
               worker should perform monitoring on its validation set and test
               set) or 'stop' (the worker should stop training).
            2) dict of format {"done":N} : used by a worker to inform the
                server that is has performed N more training iterations and
                synced its parameters. The server will respond 'stop' if the
                maximum number of training minibatches has been reached.
            3) dict of format {"valid_err":x, "test_err":x2} : used by a worker
                to inform the server that it has performed a monitoring step
                and obtained the included errors on the monitoring datasets.
                The server will respond "best" if this is the best reported
                validation error so far, otherwise it will respond 'stop' if
                the patience has been exceeded.
